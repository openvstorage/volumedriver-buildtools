#   bjam [ options... ] targets...

#   * -a; Build all targets, even if they are current.
#   * -fx; Read 'x' as the Jamfile for building instead of searching for the
#     Boost.Build system.
#   * -jx; Run up to 'x' commands concurrently.
#   * -n; Do not execute build commands. Instead print out the commands as they
#     would be executed if building.
#   * -ox; Output the used build commands to file 'x'.
#   * -q; Quit as soon as a build failure is encountered. Without this option
#     Boost.Jam will continue building as many targets as it can. print.list-item
#     -sx=y; Sets a Jam variable 'x' to the value 'y', overriding any value that
#     variable would have from the environment.
#   * -tx; Rebuild the target 'x', even if it is up-to-date.
#   * -v; Display the version of bjam.
#   * --x; Any option not explicitly handled by Boost.Jam remains available to
#     build scripts using the 'ARGV' variable.
#   * -dn; Enables output of diagnostic messages. The debug level 'n' and all
#     below it are enabled by this option.
#   * -d+n; Enables output of diagnostic messages. Only the output for debug
#     level 'n' is enabled.

# Debug Levels:

#   Each debug level shows a different set of information. Usually with higher
#   levels producing more verbose information. The following levels are supported:

#   * 0; Turn off all diagnostic output. Only errors are reported.
#   * 1; Show the actions taken for building targets, as they are executed.
#   * 2; Show quiet actions and display all action text, as they are executed.
#   * 3; Show dependency analysis, and target/source timestamps/paths.
#   * 4; Show arguments of shell invocations.
#   * 5; Show rule invocations and variable expansions.
#   * 6; Show directory/header file/archive scans, and attempts at binding to
#     targets.
#   * 7; Show variable settings.
#   * 8; Show variable fetches, variable expansions, and evaluation of 'if'
#     expressions.
#   * 9; Show variable manipulation, scanner tokens, and memory usage.
#   * 10; Show execution times for rules.
#   * 11; Show parsing progress of Jamfiles.
#   * 12; Show graph for target dependencies.
#   * 13; Show changes in target status (fate).
